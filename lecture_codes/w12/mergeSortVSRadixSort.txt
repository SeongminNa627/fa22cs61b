MergeSort Runtime
 Strings of length W?
 	- O(NlogN) if each comparison takes constant time
 	- O(WNlogN) if each comparison takes O(W) time. 
 	- it depends on the structure of the strings

 Which is faster? 
 when might LSD sort be faster? 
 	- sufficiently large N
 	- if strings are very similar to each other
 		- each merge sort comparison costs O(W)
 when mgiht MergeSort be faster?
 	- If strings are highly dissimilar from each other.
 		- each merge sort comparison is very fast

MSDSort cost model
	- if strings are all equal, we examine letters O(NW)
MergeSort cost model
	- if strings are all equal, we examine WNlogN which is a bit slower than mergesort. 

LSD Radix Sort on integers. 
	- Treat integers as a string
	- We modify LSD radix sort to work natively on integers. 
		- we can change the base, so less number of digits for each number. 
		- however, if we increase the base to decreasethe number of digits, we are increasing the size of alphabet, which again results in slowing down the algorith to use counting sort with a gaint length of frequency table.
