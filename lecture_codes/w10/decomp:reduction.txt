Topological Sorts
	- Perform a DFS traversal from every vertex with indegree 0, not clearing markings in between traversals.
		- record DFS postorder in a list
		- topological ordering is given by the reverse of that list (reverse postorder).
		- Ordering of tasks
Shortest Paths 
	- Dijkstra's algorithm visits the nodes in the order of increasing best distance.
	- Dijkstra's working even with negative edges?
		-   we visit the nodes in the topological order. 
			- meaning that it visits the nodes after updating all the edges entering into to the nodes.
