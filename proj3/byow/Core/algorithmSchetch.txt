Algorithm for Creating Rooms Never Colliding


= we will keep track of the size of each subspace of QuadTree.
    - There can be four subspaces. Two subspaces for each.

1. Randomly choose the directions.
2. Considering the two subspaces of that direction, create a room.
3. Calculate the subspaces of the room just created.
    - Here the direction where the room came from need to be considered as a bound.
4. Set the new room to become the child, and value is the eight subspaces.
